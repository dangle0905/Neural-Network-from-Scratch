# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
A neural network made from scratch using C++. The purpose of this program was to demostrate the understanding of how neural networks work.

## How to use program
There is already a training dataset for XOR in the program it is the text file. 

### Uncomment the commented area to generate your own trainining data. 
The default training data is going to teach the Neural Network to figure out an XOR problem. 2000 numbers of 1 or 0 will be generated and the correct target value. 
You can modify it to take different numbers and different targets if you want.
